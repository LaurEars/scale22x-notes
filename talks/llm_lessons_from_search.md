[Everything I Need to Know About LLM, I Learned From A Pasadena Search Company 24 Years Ago](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/everything-i-need-know-about-llm-i-learned-pasadena-search-company-24-years)

- Goto.com search company (idealab people from Caltech)
- Google AdWords was an overtime copy 
- Technology over the years: then was basic NLP, more transformers now
- Still crawling but more ingest of documents now
- Precision/Recall -> hallucination 
- LLMs aren't perfect but can still disrupt businesses (Example: Chegg)
- Economics of LLMs: subscription model is tough
- Data quality still rules: Garbage In Garbage Out 
- Old search is good with indexed data. LLMs are good with instructed data
- What's next? Multimodal LLMs, spatial intelligence, Satya Nadella: less AGI as benchmark hacking & measured by impact instead, better processors
