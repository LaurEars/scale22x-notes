[Adding API Security to your DevSecOps Toolbelt](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/adding-api-security-your-devsecops-toolbelt)

- Security and cybercrime
- DevOps vs DevSecOps
- Internal APIs does not automatically mean "safe"
- DevSecOps is a continual cycle, not linear (See DoD model)
- The organization is responsible for security, not just security team
- Important because APIs are under attack, constantly
