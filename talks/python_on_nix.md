Matteo Fusi

[Python on Nix? Yes, it is possible!](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/python-nix-yes-it-possible)

- Nix language can be confusing
- No longer maintained, so he created [a new fork](https://github.com/fusiled/python-nix), but interesting proof-of-concept: [python-nix](https://github.com/tweag/python-nix)
